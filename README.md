# Yoho
 Scott Adams adventures interpreter for VIC-20

Requires 24k RAM.

The two D64s are the final disk images.

To compile the PRG from source, you will need a version of cc65 from around 2010-2013.
Then to build the disk images, you will need to get the original game DAT files and compress them with yohoconv (source included) to my BIN format.
This should also work for any Scott Adams database format games, not just the Adams and Howarth games.
